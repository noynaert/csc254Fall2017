/**
 * Created by noynaert on 11/28/17.
 * Entity is intended to be an abstract class.
 *
 * The following recommendations are for all entities:
 *   - strength:  values should be 0.00 through 9.99
 *                any value over 2.0 is likely to be an instant kill.
 *                1.0 would be a full strength human with a sword.
 *                Something like a plant would have a strength of 0.0
 *                A bunny might have a strength of .05 unless it is a Monty Python bunny
 *                A T-Rex might have a strength of 5.5
 *    - aggressiveness:  Must be between 0 and 1.0
 *                1.0 would mean attacks at every opportunity.
 *                0.7 would attack 70% of the time and not attack 30%
 *                0 would be for something like a plant.
 *     - health:  Health also represents stamina
 *                Value should be > .10 and < 9.99
 *                Anything below .10 is considered unconscious or dead.
 *                A normal human without a shield would be a 1.0.
 *                A turtle might have a health of 1.5
 *                A daisy might have a health of .101  (slightly better than .10
 *                An oak tree might have a health of 9.99
 *
 *                Symbols are taken from unicode or just txt.
 *                For an alien you could use ðŸ‘½ or just an "A"
 *                A good source is https://emojipedia.org
 *                Using emoji will mess up printing because they are not standard width.
